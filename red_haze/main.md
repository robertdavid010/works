# Red Haze (Draft)

Project related to alternate hypothesis to better describe the 'red shift' effect.

## Abstract
The original hypothesis by Hubble as to the cause of the reddining of the night sky being a 'doppler' effect, which in turn was caused by an expanding universe, was originally only an unquantified, unqualified, and ad-hoc suggestion. Hubble himself did not prove this in any way. Furthermore, it is clearly an unevaluated or uncritiqued hypothesis. Why would one initially suggest a doppler effect as to the cause of the reddining? This would imply rapid movement of celestial bodies, an effect requiring additional complexity to explain away. Whenever hypothesis require additional and even perpetual complexity, this should be a clear indicator as to a bad line of thought, since this hypthosesis can never pass occoms razor. This is additionally suspect when a doppler effect could not actually explain the data, since the 'reddining' is non uniform across the electro magnetic spectrum, which would be a direct consequence of the doppler effect.

TLDR:

Problem with "Red Shift" theory:

1. Sky is red because of doppler effect (unproven)
2. Expanding universe (unproven, added complexity)
3. Earth is the center of the universe (false, added complexity)
4. Multiple dimenions explain away above (infinitely added complexity)

This is bad thinking.

## Hypothesis

The effect of the reddening of the night sky is caused by a Red Haze. This is the result of dust and debris from the planet Mars being thrown into orbit millenia ago by a catostrphic cosmic impact. The evidence of the impact has been surveyed on Mars already. This dust and debris has been orbiting in a similar orbit to Mars for thousands of years, and has become distributed across the entirety of the orbital sphere of the planet Mars. This also better explains Hubble's actual data, which shows a shifting in the magnetic spectrum only near or around the visible spectrum. This would be consistent with the material in the debris cloud from the Martian impact absoring and reflecting light in a manner as consistent as being caused by the dust and debris from Mars which of course has a well known red color (ie reflects red, filters other parts of the visible spectrum), and which doesnt disturm the non visible spectrum (as a visible filtering effect wouldn't).

This means there is no doppler effect causing the reddening, which means the Earth isn't the center of the 3 dimensional universe, which also means the universe is not expanding, and so there was no initial 'big bang'.

A component of this hypothesis is that academia has adopted this big bang theory because of the culture of academia, and the need to perpetuate it's 'business model' (adding infinite complexity can be complimentary to, and also the justification for, authoritarianism, as taught in the context/subtext of the classroom, which becomes a self perpetuating co-dependency as academics create complexity/justifications, to continue failing and justifaction for futher authority, which are then rewarded).
